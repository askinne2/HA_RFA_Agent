You’re at an exciting inflection point — and you’re getting great AI-led suggestions. Let’s break down how to proceed strategically so you can maximize ROI and create a scalable, intelligent solution:

⸻

✅ Step 1: YES — Build the Matching Algorithm

Why: Matching is the core logic of your AI assistant. It determines whether responses feel intelligent or generic.

Use the Provided Criteria:
	•	Implement a scoring function based on:
	•	Language match
	•	Region (Zip/County/Region proximity)
	•	Income or age eligibility (if applicable)
	•	Category / subcategory match
	•	Availability (hours / walk-in vs appointment)

🧠 Tip: For v0.1, you can simplify it to:

score = (
    0.3 * language_score +
    0.2 * proximity_score +
    0.2 * income_score +
    0.15 * availability_score +
    0.15 * category_match_score
)

Cursor can help you turn that into a real-time function that ranks all resources per user request.

🧠 Step 2: YES — Refine Subcategories from Real Call Log

Why: The real value of your system will come from how granular and aligned the subcategories are to how people actually ask for help.

Next Actions:
	•	Load your redacted RFA call log
	•	Group requests by Type of Request and free-text fields like Legal, Financial, Education, etc.
	•	Identify themes or frequent phrases
	•	Use them to:
	•	Add missing subcategories (e.g., “Workplace Harassment” under Legal)
	•	Adjust existing ones (“ESL” vs “Adult Literacy”)

🧠 Tip: If you want, I can generate a frequency breakdown of those fields and suggest a new list of subcategories.

📌 TL;DR — Proceed with All Three

Task	Priority	Why
Migrate to new schema	🔥 High	Needed for matching, retrieval, and scale
Build scoring-based matcher	🔥 High	Core to assistant intelligence and trustworthiness
Add real-world-driven subcategories	✅ Medium	Improves accuracy and user satisfaction long term
